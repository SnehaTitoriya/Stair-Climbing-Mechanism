# Automated Load Carrier

## Open projects 2022

## Abstract

This project deals with the design and simulation of an automated mechanism for stair climbing to lift load over staircase flight.

This project offers an alternative to carrying load in buildings that do not have elevators. It is an automated system in which the load can be carried by the bot itself through a flight of stairs.

## Scissor Mechanism Design

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project essentially originated from our desire to learn new things. We can use this autonomous bot in case . Although this technology is relatively unused in India, it can be used to carry heavy loads where elevators or escalators are unavailable.

## **Mechanical Aspect of Design**

The Mechanical Design is explicitly made for significant weight carrying capacity using mild steel as a material having composition of 0.20-0.30% Carbon and Manganese. It is sturdy and reliable and can easily transverse through domestic terrain. Plywood is used as the base for our project.

## **Simulation**

For simulation purpose we used the following softwares :-

- Solidworks
    
    > For mechanical designing of our BOT.
    > 
- Coppeliasim
    
    > For simulating Stair climbing, Wall detection, Wheel PID and Fire detection.
    > 
- Python and openCV
    
    > For Image processing to detect fire and marking that center of fire (high intensity zone) with circle.
    >

## **Applications**

- The main objective of the automated load carrier. Sensors are used to evaluate the environment in which the bot is operating and allows the bot to adjust actions based on collected data. The buzzer used will be helpful in alarming people about the danger.
- As it is an autonomus bot which uses Controllers and image processing, so it can help us to control fire without human inputs.
- Using this bot we can minimise delays and unavailiblity of services during emergency.
- It can be highly useful in extinguishing fire where probability of explosion is high. For eg. Hotel kitchens, LPG/CNG gas stores, etc.

## **Limitations**

- Takes time to detect fire
- Needs manual assistance while changing the fire extinguishers
- Usable for household fires only

## **Future Improvement**

- Install cameras in every room
- Link with smoke sensors in the area
- Use custom made cylinders to avoid manual assistance
