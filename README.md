# Stair-Climbing-Mechanism
## Open projects 2022

## Abstract

This project deals with the design and simulation of an automated mechanism for stair climbing to lift load over staircase flight.

It is easy with the help of wheels on straight-level paths carrying heavy loads but it is a challenge in the case of stairs. 

This project offers an alternative to carrying load in buildings that do not have elevators. It is an automated system in which the load can be carried by the bot itself through a flight of stairs.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project essentially originated from our desire to learn new things. We can use this autonomous bot in case . Although this technology is relatively unused in India, it can significantly impact the lives we lose to Fire incidents and our complete dependency on Emergency services.
